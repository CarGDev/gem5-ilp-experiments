# Multiple Issue (Superscalar Execution) Analysis Report

## Superscalar Configuration Setup

Superscalar processors represent a fundamental advancement in computer architecture that enables multiple instructions to be issued and executed simultaneously within a single processor core. This approach exploits instruction-level parallelism (ILP) by allowing the processor to identify and execute independent instructions in parallel, significantly improving performance beyond traditional scalar processors (Hennessy & Patterson, 2019). The superscalar design relies on sophisticated hardware mechanisms including dynamic instruction scheduling, register renaming, and out-of-order execution to maximize instruction throughput while maintaining program correctness.

The experimental setup employs four distinct superscalar configurations with varying pipeline widths (W1, W2, W4, W8), representing different levels of instruction-level parallelism capability. Each configuration utilizes the same underlying O3 (Out-of-Order) processor model with LTAGE branch prediction, but scales the pipeline width parameters to evaluate the impact of increased issue capability on overall system performance. The configurations maintain consistent memory hierarchy and functional unit specifications while systematically varying the core pipeline parameters.

## Discussion on Instruction Mix and Performance Gains

### Findings & Interpretation

The experimental results reveal a counterintuitive and significant finding: **increasing pipeline width from 1 to 8 instructions per cycle produces virtually no performance improvement**, with IPC remaining essentially constant at approximately 0.0477 across all configurations. This observation challenges conventional expectations about superscalar scaling and highlights fundamental limitations in exploiting instruction-level parallelism.

The lack of performance scaling can be attributed to several critical bottlenecks that become increasingly apparent with wider pipelines. First, the extremely high data cache miss rate (~50%) creates a severe memory bottleneck that dominates execution time. When nearly half of all memory accesses result in cache misses requiring L2 access (20-cycle latency), the processor spends significant time stalled waiting for memory operations to complete, regardless of pipeline width capability.

Second, the workload exhibits limited instruction-level parallelism, as evidenced by the minimal variation in branch misprediction rates and the consistent execution patterns across configurations. The memtouch workload appears to contain significant data dependencies and memory access patterns that prevent effective parallel execution, despite the processor's ability to issue multiple instructions simultaneously.

The slight increase in instruction cache miss rates with wider pipelines (3.15% to 3.77%) suggests that wider fetch mechanisms may be accessing instruction streams less efficiently, potentially due to increased instruction cache pressure or less optimal prefetching behavior. This trend indicates that simply increasing fetch width without corresponding improvements in instruction cache design can actually degrade performance.

The branch misprediction rates show a modest increase from 702 to 799 incorrect predictions, representing a 13.8% increase across the pipeline width range. This suggests that wider pipelines may be executing more speculative instructions before branch resolution, leading to increased misprediction penalties that offset potential performance gains.

### Key Takeaways

- **Memory bottleneck dominance**: The 50% data cache miss rate creates a fundamental performance ceiling that cannot be overcome through increased pipeline width alone
- **Limited ILP in workload**: The memtouch benchmark exhibits insufficient instruction-level parallelism to benefit from wider superscalar execution
- **Diminishing returns**: Pipeline width scaling shows no measurable performance improvement, indicating that other system components become the limiting factors
- **Cache pressure effects**: Wider pipelines may increase instruction cache pressure, leading to slightly higher miss rates
- **Speculation overhead**: Increased branch misprediction rates with wider pipelines suggest that speculation becomes less effective at higher issue rates

The results demonstrate that superscalar design effectiveness is highly dependent on workload characteristics and system balance. Simply increasing pipeline width without addressing memory hierarchy limitations or ensuring sufficient instruction-level parallelism in the workload will not yield performance improvements. This analysis underscores the importance of holistic system design and workload-aware optimization in modern processor architecture.
